CNNs automatically learn spatial features (edges, textures, shapes, objects) by applying convolution operations using learnable filters.\n","\n","- A Fully Connected Neural Network (also called Multilayer Perceptron) connects every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next.\n","\n","2.Discuss the architecture of LeNet-5 and explain how it laid the foundation\n","for modern deep learning models in computer vision. Include references to its original\n","research paper.\n","\n","- LeNet-5 is one of the earliest and most influential Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), proposed by Yann LeCun et al. in the late 1990s. It was primarily designed for handwritten digit recognition (such as ZIP code and bank cheque recognition) and laid the conceptual and architectural foundation for modern deep learning models in computer vision.\n","\n","- Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner (1998)\n","“Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition”\n","\n","3.Compare and contrast AlexNet and VGGNet in terms of design principles,\n","number of parameters, and performance. Highlight key innovations and limitations of\n","each.\n","\n","- AlexNet and VGGNet are two landmark convolutional neural network architectures that significantly influenced the evolution of deep learning in computer vision. While both were designed for large-scale image classification on the ImageNet dataset, they differ notably in their design philosophy, complexity, and performance.\n","- AlexNet, introduced in 2012 by Alex Krizhevsky and colleagues, was the first deep CNN to demonstrate a dramatic improvement in image classification accuracy. Its architecture consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers. AlexNet employs relatively large convolution filters such as 11×11 and 5×5 in the initial layers, which allow rapid reduction of spatial dimensions. A major design principle of AlexNet was to make deep learning feasible on available hardware, achieved through GPU-based training and architectural simplifications.\n","- VGGNet, proposed in 2014 by Simonyan and Zisserman, was designed with the principle that increasing network depth using small, consistent convolution filters leads to better performance. VGGNet uses only 3×3 convolution kernels stacked sequentially, which effectively increases the receptive field while keeping the architecture simple and uniform. Popular versions such as VGG-16 and VGG-19 contain 16 and 19 weight layers respectively, making them much deeper than AlexNet.\n","\n","4.What is transfer learning in the context of image classification? Explain\n","how it helps in reducing computational costs and improving model performance with\n","limited data.\n","- Transfer learning in the context of image classification is a deep learning technique in which a model trained on a large and general image dataset is reused for a new but related task. Instead of training a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch, a pretrained model such as VGG, ResNet, Inception, or MobileNet—already trained on large datasets like ImageNet—is adapted to classify images from a new target dataset.\n","- In image classification, the early layers of a CNN learn generic visual features such as edges, corners, textures, and shapes, while the deeper layers learn task-specific features. Transfer learning leverages this property by reusing the learned weights of early layers and modifying or retraining only the final layers for the new classification problem.\n","\n","5.Describe the role of residual connections in ResNet architecture. How do\n","they address the vanishing gradient problem in deep CNNs?\n","- Residual connections are the core idea behind the ResNet (Residual Network) architecture, introduced by He et al. in 2015, and they enable the successful training of very deep convolutional neural networks (50, 101, or even 152 layers).\n","- Mathematically, instead of learning a function\n","𝐻\n","(\n","𝑥\n",")\n","H(x), the network learns\n","𝐹\n","(\n","𝑥\n",")\n","=\n","𝐻\n","(\n","𝑥\n",")\n","−\n","𝑥\n","F(x)=H(x)−x, and the final output becomes\n","𝑦\n","=\n","𝐹\n","(\n","𝑥\n",")\n","+\n","𝑥\n","y=F(x)+x. This makes it easier for the network to learn identity mappings when deeper layers are not needed.\n","\n","6.Implement the LeNet-5 architectures using Tensorflow or PyTorch to\n","classify the MNIST dataset.
